# Py-Sharp
Py-Sharp, My Custom Programming language

Py-Sharp is my custom programming language based in Python, Paying respects to Python in it's name.

# How do I know how to code in PY-Sharp?
Well, You will find a tutorial.txt which will teach you the basics of PY-Sharp.
There is currently no big reason to learn everything of Py-Sharp, But I'm sure there will be in the future!

# Why Did You Make Py-Sharp?
I made it because I was bored, but then escalated the project for a joke. Coding massive projects as a single-developer for some reason is like a hobby to me.
You can always help me, because there is a LOT you could help me with (I won't pay you, this is voluntary, but any help is greatly appreciated)

# History
Py-Sharp was previously called Py-C, But changed to Py-Sharp Because I really Liked the Sound Of C#, But with the C being Py.
